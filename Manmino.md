# 0. Foreword

Manmino is a constructed East Asian Auxiliary language intended to bridge the gap between the diverse but undeniably interconnected cultural region of East Asia, spanning from Japan to Myanmar and Mongolia to Indonesia. Utilizing a phonetic inventory that balances ubiquity without overly favoring any one group, a simple agglutinating yet analytic SOV structure with high structural flexibility, and vocabulary drawing from a well balanced mix of languages such as Classical Chinese, Sanskrit, and other regional languages, Manmino aims to be a nuanced yet easy to use language for those in East Asia.  

The cause for which Manmino stands behind is fostering a sense of unity in East Asia that would triumph over historic tensions and rivalries in the region by creating a platform for international communication that is more easily accessible than English, as well as fostering free flow of information and ideas in the region beyond government, cultural, or linguistic barriers in a manner that prevents the domination of any one particular entity in the region’s artistic and intellectual environment.

As one idealistic Pan-Asianist said a hundred years ago, “Success through union and defeat through disunion is a law of nature known to all”; Team Manmino hopes that through learning and using this language, people of East Asia would be able to successfully work together to create and share great feats of art and intellect.
 

# 1. The Alphabet and Sound System

Manmino is written in the Latin Alphabet (Latin Aksala or Latin Munji in Manmino), a system familiar to all in East Asia and Southeast Asia. One may optionally use Manmino Aksala, an pseudo-abugida specifically designed for Manmino, only in limited situations where the Latin Alphabet cannot be used for various reasons.   

The Manimno Alphabet (Manmino Aksala) uses the following letters:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P S T U W Y

a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p s t u w y ’

## 1.1 The Consonants

Manmino has the following consonants.

  


| | Labial | Dental | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
|--------------------|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| Nasal | m | n | | | ng /ŋ/<sup>1</sup> |
| Stop (Fortis)<sup>2</sup>| p /p<sup>h</sup>/ | t /t<sup>h</sup>/ | | k /k<sup>h</sup>/ | ’ /ʔ/<sup>3</sup> |
| Stop (Lenis) | b | d | | g | |
| Affricate (Fortis) | | | c /tɕ<sup>h</sup>/ | | |
| Affricate (Lenis) | | | j /dʑ/ | | |
| Fricative | f /ɸ ~ f/ | s /ɕ/ | | | h /x ∼ h/ |
| Lateral | | l | | | |
| Semivowel | | | y /j/ | w | |

  

1. The phoneme [ŋ] may not be used as an initial consonant.
2. The precise realization of Fortis consonants and Lenis consonants is provisionally left
undefined due to split demographic preferences in greater East Asia.
3. The phoneme [ʔ] may only occur between syllables.
4. ⟨s⟩ is pronounced as [ɕ] when preceding ⟨y⟩ or ⟨i⟩.
5. Among all consonants in Manmino, only the nasals [m], [n], [ŋ], non-glottal Fortis stops [p], [t], [k], and the lateral [l] can be used as coda consonants.
6. Other letters of the Latin Alphabet not included here such as ⟨q⟩, ⟨x⟩, ⟨z⟩, may be used to write proper nouns.

In such cases, the word as a whole should be pronounced as accurate to the language of origin as possible.

  

## 1.2 The Vowels

  

Manmino has five vowels: a, e, i, o, u. Manmino also allows for the following diphtongs and triphthongs.

  

| | -∅<sup>1</sup> | -w | -y |
|-------------------|--|---|-----|
| a-  |    | aw  | ay  |
| wa- | wa | waw | way |
| ya- | ya | yaw | yay |
| o-  |    | ow  | oy  |
| yo- | yo | yow |     |
| e-  |    | ew  | ey  |
| ye- <sup>2</sup> | ye | yew | yey |
| we- | we |     | wey |
| yu- | yu |     | yuy |
| wi- | wi |     |     |

  

1. Consonants cannot come after ⟨w⟩ or ⟨y⟩, but they can come after ⟨u⟩ or ⟨i⟩.

2. In front of the vowel ⟨e⟩, ⟨y⟩ is only allowed as a initial consonant and not as a glide. The only exception to this is after ⟨s⟩.

  

## 1.3 Phonology Explanation

  

Overall, Manmino's phonetic inventory has been developed methodically. After obtaining the full phonetic inventory of 20 major languages in greater East Asia, 
the phonetic inventory of each language was cataloged and assigned a value equal to the cube root of the language’s speakers.
Then all phonetic inventories were added together,
and the phonemes that had a value exceeding the halfway point were added while the rest were culled.

Using the phonemes listed above, Manmino utilizes C1VC2 syllable structure: with C1 excluding [ŋ] and [ʔ]; V being any of the short vowel, diphthong, or triphthong listed above save for the listed exceptions; and C2 being limited to the nasals [m], [n], [ŋ], non-glottal Fortis stops [p], [t], [k], and the lateral [l].
As mentioned earlier, [ʔ] occurs in between syllables rather than as part of any one syllable.
The glottal stop is only necessary in disambiguation, and therefore may be considered mostly non-phonemic in common usage.

In order to accommodate a wider array of speakers and to facilitate faster speech,
Manmino allows flexible allophonic pronunciation of certain digraphs. Those rules are as follows:
  
* The Nasal Coda Rule: If a nasal coda ⟨m⟩, ⟨n⟩, ⟨ng⟩ is followed by a plosive or affricate of a different place of articulation, the nasal coda may be articulated at the place of articulation for the following consonant instead of the one for its original place of articulation. For example, the digraph ⟨mk⟩ can be pronounced as [ŋk] rather than [mk]. For this rule, Palatal consonants are considered a subset of Dental consonants.
* The Stop Coda Rule: If a stop coda ⟨p⟩, ⟨t⟩, ⟨k⟩ is followed by one of the lenis consonant ⟨b⟩, ⟨d⟩, ⟨j⟩, ⟨g⟩, the coda can be dropped in exchange for pronouncing the following consonant as its fortis counterpart.
* The ⟨ph⟩ Rule: The diagraph ⟨ph⟩ may be pronounced as /f/.
* The ⟨ty/dy⟩ Rule: The digraphs ⟨ty⟩ and ⟨dy⟩ may be pronounced as /tɕ/ and /dʑ/ respectively.
* The ⟨kh⟩ Rule: In the diagraph ⟨kh⟩, the /k/ may be dropped.
  
In case of any confusion, it is recommended that you clarify your pronunciation to the best of your ability by either inserting dummy vowels or simply not utilizing the above diagraph rules in favor of speaking slower.

  
# 2. Particles and Syntactic Grammar

In order to fit multiple word order different speakers of Manmino may prefer, Manmino is structured as an SOV language with postpositional function-markers that allow for a high tolerance for scrambling of arguments akin to Japanese or Korean. Simply put, the language has markers that clarify what a word is doing in a sentence so that people can say words in the order they want to. 

In addition, in Manmino, the syntactic function of a word as a noun, verb, adjective or adverb is not always innate, but can be clarified or modified through use of certain particles. As such, in Manmino, words in isolation are classified not as nouns, verbs, and modifiers, but as objects and concepts, actions and phenomena, and qualities. Their function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb is determined by the particles around them. As a result, understanding the different function marking particles of Manmino is key to understanding Manmino syntax as well as the grammar in general.
  
## 2.1 Noun Particles

Manmino nouns are marked with the following postpositional particles that determine the function of the noun.
  
| Particle  | Function | Description |
|:---------------:|:-----------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| na |  Topic  | Marks the noun phrase as the topic of the sentence. Similarly to Japanese and Korean, the particle may also be used to also emphasize a noun as the subject. |
| ∅ | Nominative | In Manmino, the subject is unmarked. |
| lu | Accusative | Marks the noun as the direct object of the sentence. It is optional when word order is Subject-Object-Verb, but otherwise is required. |
| ji* | Genitive | Marks the noun as the possessor of the next item in the noun phrase. |
| bat | Ablative | Marks the noun as the origin of the verb. Equivalent to English "from". |
| bang |  Lative | Marks the noun as the destination of the verb. Equivalent to English "to" when used in referencing a location. |
| ne <sup>1</sup> |  Dative | Marks the noun as the indirect object of the sentence. Equivalent to "to" in reference to a target of action. |
| ne <sup>2</sup> |  Agent  | Marks the noun as the agent in a passive voice construction. Equivalent to the prepositional ”by”. |
| la | Quoting | Marks a noun or a noun phrase as a quote or a hypothetical. |

*: _ji_ also has other uses in changing word function as well. See 2.3.

"Topic" here refers to the grammatical concept that pertains to an argument already understood in context. Its use is optional in Manmino, and use would serve to merely emphasize this function, similarly to how an argument already understood to be the direct object would still take a *-lu* suffix when its function is being emphasized. This is 

Manmino nouns are notable for not accounting for number or any gender: plurality in Manmino can be emphasized with either reduplication of the noun or with the suffix _-tat_.

## 2.2 Pronouns

  
Manmino has a simple system of pronouns. In terms of personal pronouns,
Manmino has the first person pronoun _a_, the second person pronoun _ni_, and the third person pronoun _ta_. There are also _kun_, _nyang_, _ini_, which are gendered and intimate alternatives to the second or third person pronouns. Each corresponds to male, female, and neuter.  

Manmino has a modular system for generating other pronouns. Manmino pronouns have the following demonstrative parameters: first person proximal _ko_, non-first person proximal _co_, distal _yo_, interrogative _ha_, existential _hok_, universal _man_, negative _mu_, and alternative _ta_. These can be optionally suffixed to specify the target being demonstrated. Objects are suffixed with _-ka_, people are suffixed with _-nin_, times are suffixed with _-si_, places are suffixed with _-di_, causes are suffixed with _-yu_, and method is suffixed with _-'i_. It is noted that many universal pronouns do not use the standard target specifying suffixes due to prevailing pre-existing words in Sinoxenic languages.

 
| | 1st Proximal | Non-1st Proximal | Distal | Interrogative | Particular | Universal | Negative | Alternative |
|---------|--------------|------------------|--------|---------------|------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| | this | that | yon  | Which | Certain  | All | None | Other |
| General | ko | co | yo | ha | hok | man | mu | ta |
| Object | koko | coko | yoko | haka | hokko | manmut* | muku | taka |
| Person | konin | conin | yonin | hanin | hoknin | manmin* | munin  | tanin |
| Time  | kosi | cosi | yosi | hasi | hoksi | syangsi* | musi | tasi |
| Place | kodi | codi | yodi | hadi | hokdi | manbang* | mudi | tadi |
| Reason | koyu | coyu | yoyu | hayu | hokyu | manyu | muyu | tayu |
| Method | ko'i | co'i | yo'i | ha'i | hok'i | man'i | mu'i | ta'i |


## 2.3 Verb Modifiers

Manmino verbs are affixed with optional particles for multiple aspects, conveying information in the following order.

| Passive / Causative| Polite | Imperative | Progressive | Completion |  Time | Final  |
|:-------:|:------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:----------:|:---------:|:------------:|
|  li /hi | si | ye | jung  | le / kalu | le / kalu | ya / ka / ne |

  

* Passive _li_ changes the verb so that the subject is no longer doing the verb, but the verb is being done to the subject.
* Causative _hi_ changes the verb so that the subject is no longer doing the verb to themselves, but causing another target to do the verb.
* Polite _si_ is one way a Manmino speaker can show reverence to the subject.
* Imperative _ye_ marks the verb as a command.
* Progressive marks a verb is in the middle of being performed at whichever time that is being referred to (assumed present, if otherwise unmarked).
* Completion can be either marked with le (perfect) and kalu (prospective). They normally only function if the tense for the verb is already marked.
* Time marks when the verb is happening. _le_ marks the past, _kalu_ marks the future, and the present tense is unmarked. However, it is acceptable to drop tense marking if apparent.
* Final marks the verb in multiple ways. _ya_ marks a sentence as an exclamation, _ka_ marks a sentence as a strong question, and _ne_ marks a sentence as a weak question or a suggestion.
  
It is noted here that prior versions of Manmino described time marking preceding completion, but now has been switched to better reflect the Korean tense-stacking system from which this system has been borrowed from.
  
## 2.4 Word Function Modifiers

  
As stated earlier, in Manmino, all base words are classified as Actions and Phenomenon, Objects and Concepts, or Qualities. Generally, each corresponds to verbs, nouns, and adjectives or adverbs.
However, there are often cases where a word is not used in the manner most natural for its meaning.
In those cases, a word generally must take on a helping verb or a particle to function properly.
The modifiers are as such:

| | Verb | Noun | Adverb | Adjective |
|:---------------------:|:----:|:----:|:---------:|:------:|
| Actions and Phenomena | ∅ | -em |  ∅<sup>1</sup> | -ji |
| Objects and Concepts | heng | ∅ |  -yang | -dek |
| Quality | cey | -em | ∅ |  ∅ |
  
1: An action or phenomenon being "used as an adverb" is generally expressed more commonly as verb chains, which can simply be put next to each other without modification.

It is noted here that previous versions of Manmino had the particle marking an O/C as an adverb as _-syang_, but it is now changed to _-yang_ to make pronunciation easier and better reflect Classical Chinese and Japanese, which uses the corresponding etymology more frequently.
It is also noted here that previous versions of Manmino had a separate particle for a perfective action being transformed into an adjective with a particle _-in_, but this has been removed in favor of _-le-ji_.

Negation is also another type of word function modifier, and quite unique in that it is the only prefixing particle in Manmino. Manmino negates verbs with a _but-_, and negates adjectives and adverbs with _bi-_. _But-cey_ can be abbreviated to _bey_.   

## 2.5 Independent Particles and Complex Sentences

There are also particles that function independently from words instead of being attached to any one phrase. These can either function as conjunctions placed between clauses, or be used at the start of the sentence as a function marker for the phrase.
 
| Conjunction | Description |
|:-----------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| dan | Equivalent to ᅟbut, however, still, or only. Sets the following clause as a prevailing clause. |
| butdan  | Equivalent to not only. Sets the following clause as a compounding clause. 
| hok | Equivalent to or. Sets two clauses as alternatives to one another. |
| hwa | Equivalent to and. Sets two nouns as part of one noun phrase. |
| i | Equivalent to and. Sets two clauses as being coordinate to each other. |
| pi | Sets two clauses as objects of comparisons to each other. |
  
 
| Functional | Description |
|:----------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  geng  | Equivalent to through. Marks the following two clauses as a transient clause and a final clause. |
|  nyak  | Equivalent to if. Marks the following two clauses as a hypothetical clause and a concluding clause. |
|  syuy  | Equivalent to even if. Marks the following two clauses as an obstructing clause and a prevailing clause. |
| wi | Equivalent to for. Marks the following two clauses as an objective clause and an instrumental clause. |
| yu | Equivalent to because. Marks the following two clauses as a causal clause and a final clause. |
  
Functionals can also be negated with a _but-_. In those cases, it is assumed that the following sentence will clarify the relationship between the subject and the following verb phrase.

## 2.6 Numbers
In Manmino, numbers are used to mark abstract value, quantities, or place in a list.
Abstract values are expressed either in their isolated Sanskrit form (for numbers 0-10) or as a compound formed from Sinitic roots (any other numbers). Quantities are expressed the same way, but they must be followed by a counter word and then a _-ji_ . The counter _hway_ is used for the amount of an action, _gay_ is used for countable inanimate nouns, _dow_ is used for animals, and _meng_ is used for people. Ordinal numbers take a prefix _je-_ as well as the suffix _-ji_.   

## 2.7 Honorifics
In Manmino, there are three degrees of marking honorifics to consider. First is the respectful honorific level. In Manmino, one may mark respect for a referent by not using personal pronouns or names and instead using titles. If the referent is the subject of a phrase, the honorific marker _-si-_ should be used in the verb (See 2.2 Verb Modifiers). The second degree of honorifics is neutral, which is unmarked. The last degree of honorifics is intimate, which involves the use of the intimate pronouns _kun_, _nyang_, _ini_, or a nickname in place of a formal name or title. 

## 2.8 Other notes on grammar

 
# 3. Vocabulary

Vocabulary in Manmino comes from a variety of different languages. While some words are defined in the dictionary, Manmino generally has an open-ended vocabulary where words can come from any language, although words with widespread recognition are preferred over words used only in individual languages, and monosyllabic words should be avoided except for the most basic words. There are six different categories for where words can come from, with different situations calling for different source languages. These recommendations should not be considered to be exact rules, but should be interpreted flexibly according to the needs of the language. 

The first category is of words of Sinitic origin. Generally, this refers to words from Classical Chinese which was the spoken language of Tang-Song dynasty China and the traditional written lingua franca of China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam. Words that are derived from Classical Chinese, or new words coined through processes followed in Classical Chinese, cannot be loaned solely based on one modern pronunciation of one language, but instead must be loaned based on a simplified version of the pronunciation they would have had during the Tang-Song eras in China, as that is the origin from which almost all modern readings derive from. Details on this process will follow in another section. Manmino users are recommended to loan words from the Sinitic category when it comes to matters of Daoism, Confucianism, politics, diplomacy, economics, or other similar topics, and are recommended to especially not loan words from the Sinitic category when it comes to names of plants or animals. It is also recommended that if creating new words not sourced from another language, users of Manmino should utilize Sinitic stems following established conventions for creating Classical Sinitic words, in the interest of compactness.
  
The second category is words of Sanskrit origin. While India itself is not under the scope of Manmino, many languages in South East Asia considered Sanskrit and Pali as prestige languages due to religious reasons, and even in the Confucian realm of Vietnam, China, Korea, and Japan, had some vocabulary influences. As such, Sanskrit is an important language to consider. Sanskrit words should be loaned from its original form, adapted following the convention for external vocabulary (further explained below), with consonant adaptations following conventions found in the languages that use the word, and being shortened as needed. Manmino users are especially recommended to loan words from Sanskrit when it comes to matters of Indic religions and philosophy.   

The third category is words of Korean or Japanese origin. While Korean and Japanese have no proven relationship, they are well known to share many mutual similarities in grammar as well as some similarities of vocabulary in their shared sprachbund, and as such considered to be in one category. There is no specific rules for how to adapt a word from this category as they conform to Manmino phonetics quite well, with the few exceptions generally still have obvious solutions, and the cognates they share are also too irregular to create definitive rules for (hence why they are considered language isolates). Manmino users are recommended to use words of this category when it comes to matters of nature of cold or temperate climates, as well as words pertaining to the natural world in general, especially if there is a found overlap between Korean and Japanese.   

The fourth category is words of Austroasian origin. Unlike general usage of the term "Austroasian" in most academic contexts, in discussion of Manmino, Austroasia refers to all of continental Southeast Asia, including the Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar. Continental Southeast Asia, or Austroasia, also forms a sprachbund where various languages share words either from genetic reasons or from exchange. Like as is the case for the Koreo-Japonic Sprachbund, the cognates they share are also too irregular to create definitive rules for adapting. Manmino users are recommended to use words of this category when it comes to matters of nature of tropical climates, as well as words pertaining to the natural world in general, if there is a found overlap among Austroasian languages.   

The fifth category is words of Austronesian origin. The Austronesian language family is the dominant language family in most of Maritime Southeast Asia, and today spans Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, to a certain extent Taiwan, Singapore, among other nations. The languages of the Austronesian family often share cognates, and as such the shared vocabulary should be used whenever possible, especially in matters of navigation or the natural world in general.

The sixth category is words of external origin. These words are from languages primarily spoken outside the Manmino realm, such as Arabic, Spanish, or English. They are generally words that refer to information-era technologies, Abrahamic faiths, or other words that have commonly remained un-nativized in Asia. Outside of those specific scopes, it is not recommended to use these words when there are other words in Manmino that would work. 

As Manmino has a limited syllable structure, all words must be reformed to fit the phonology of Manmino. To break consonant clusters, syllables should be broken up into CV blocks, adapting all sounds to ones used in Manmino and inserting filler vowels between each consonant as needed. The rest of this section will describe how different 

## 3.1 Loaning from Classical Chinese 

## 3.2 Loaning from Sanskrit 

## 3.3 Loaning from Latin

## 3.3 Loaning Words from Other Languages
Manmino, despite having a highly technical description, does not aim to a fully prescribed language but a flexible protocol for natural communication. As such, these rules are best understood to be guidelines that can be interpreted freely as needed by speakers of Manmino. Speakers of Manmino should periodically formalize new conventions and record in or redact from this section the new conventions in the future, but these are some rules to consider.

Filler vowels in this context can be either *i*, *a*, or *u*, depending on whether the core vowel of the original syllable was an unrounded front vowel, a middle vowel, or a rear vowel or rounded vowel. Sound conversion should follow conventions set by other languages for the specific word being loaned, but it is generally recommended _v_ goes to _b_ or _w_ instead of _f_ , _z_ goes to _s_, and treat aspirated consonants as their unaspirated counterparts. However, it is emphasized that this is merely a recommendation, and as long as the loans are recognizable, they are legal.
