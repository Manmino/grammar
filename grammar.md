# 1. Foreword
Manmino is a constructed East Asian Auxiliary language 
intended to bridge the gap between the diverse but undeniably interconnected cultural region of East Asia, 
spanning from Japan to Myanmar and Mongolia to Indonesia. 
Utilizing a phonetic inventory that balances ubiquity without overly favoring any one group, 
a simple agglutinating yet analytic SOV structure with high structural flexibility, 
and vocabulary drawing from a well balanced mix of languages such as Classical Chinese, Sanskrit, and other regional languages,
Manmino aims to be a nuanced yet easy to use language for those in East Asia.

The cause for which Manmino stands behind is 
fostering a sense of unity in East Asia that would triumph over historic tensions and rivalries in the region 
by creating a platform for international communication that is more easily accessible than English, 
as well as fostering free flow of information and ideas in the region beyond government, cultural, or linguistic barriers 
in a manner that prevents the domination of any one particular entity 
in the region’s artistic and intellectual environment.

As one idealistic Pan-Asianist said a hundred years ago, 
“Success through union and defeat through disunion is a law of nature known to all”; 
Team Manmino hopes that through learning and using this language, 
people of East Asia would be able to successfully work together to create and share great feats of art and intellect.

# 1. The Alphabet and Sound System
Manmino is written in the Latin Alphabet (Latin Aksala or Latin Munji in Manmino), 
a system familiar to all in East Asia and Southeast Asia.
One may optionally use Manmino Aksala, an pseudo-abugida specifically designed for Manmino,
only in limited situations where the Latin Alphabet cannot be used for various reasons.

The Manimno Alphabet (Manmino Aksala) uses the following letters:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P S T U W Y

a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p s t u w y ’

## 1.1 The Consonants

Manmino has the following consonants.

|                    |       Labial      |      Dental       |       Palatal       |       Velar       |      Glottal      |
|--------------------|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| Nasal              |         m         |         n         |                     |                   |      ng /ŋ/<sup>1</sup>       |
| Stop (Fortis)<sup>2</sup>| p /p<sup>h</sup>/ | t /t<sup>h</sup>/ |                     | k /k<sup>h</sup>/ |       ’ /ʔ/<sup>3</sup>       |
| Stop (Lenis)       |         b         |         d         |                     |         g         |                   |
| Affricate (Fortis) |                   |                   |  c /tɕ<sup>h</sup>/ |                   |                   |
| Affricate (Lenis)  |                   |                   |        j /dʑ/       |                   |                   |
| Fricative          |     f /ɸ ~ f/     |       s /ɕ/       |                     |                   |     h /x ∼ h/     |
| Lateral            |                   |         l         |                     |                   |                   |
| Semivowel          |                   |                   |        y /j/        |         w         |                   |

1. The phoneme [ŋ] may not be used as an initial consonant.
2. The precise realization of Fortis consonants and Lenis consonants is provisionally left
undefined due to split demographic preferences in greater East Asia.
3. The phoneme [ʔ] may only occur between syllables.
4. ⟨s⟩ is pronounced as [ɕ] when preceding ⟨y⟩ or ⟨i⟩.
5. Among all consonants in Manmino, only the nasals [m], [n], [ŋ], non-glottal Fortis stops
[p], [t], [k], and the lateral [l] can be used as coda consonants.
6. Other letters of the Latin Alphabet not included here such as ⟨q⟩, ⟨x⟩, ⟨z⟩, may be used to write proper nouns. 
In such cases, the word as a whole should be pronounced as accurate to the language of origin as possible. 

## 1.2 The Vowels

Manmino has five vowels: a, e, i, o, u. Manmino also allows for the following diphtongs and triphthongs. 

|                   | +∅<sup>1</sup> |  +w | +y  |
|-------------------|:--:|:---:|-----|
| a - initial       |    |  aw | ay  |
| wa - initial      | wa | waw | way |
| ya - initial      | ya | yaw | yay |
| o - initial       |    |  ow | oy  |
| yo - initial      | yo | yow |     |
| e - initial       |    |  ew | ey  |
| ye - initial<sup>2</sup>     | ye | yew | yey |
| we - initial      | we |     | wey |
| yu - initial      | yu |     |     |
| wi - initial      | wi |     |     |

1. Consonants cannot come after ⟨w⟩ or ⟨y⟩, but they can come after ⟨u⟩ or ⟨i⟩.
2. In front of the vowel ⟨e⟩, ⟨y⟩ is only allowed as a initial consonant and not as a glide.
The only exception is after ⟨s⟩.

## 1.3 Phonology Explanation

Overall, Manmino's phonetic inventory has been developed methodically. 
After obtaining the full phonetic inventory of 20 major languages in greater East Asia,
the phonetic inventory of each language was catalogued and assigned a value equal to the cube root of the language’s speakers. 
Then all phonetic inventories were added together,
and the phonemes that had a value exceeding the halfway point were added while the rest were culled. 

Using the phonemes listed above, Manmino utilizes C1VC2 syllable structure: with C1 excluding [ŋ] and [ʔ];
V being any of the short vowel, diphthong, or triphthong listed above save for the listed exceptions;
and C2 being limited to the nasals [m], [n], [ŋ], non-glottal Fortis stops [p], [t], [k], and the lateral [l]. 
As mentioned earlier, [ʔ] occurs in between syllables rather than as part of any one syllable. 
The glottal stop is only necessary in disambiguation, 
and therefore may be considered mostly non-phonemic in common usage.

In order to accommodate a wider array of speakers and to facilitate faster speech, 
Manmino allows flexible allophonic pronunciation of certain diagraphs. Those rules are as follows:

* The Nasal Coda Rule: If a nasal coda ⟨m⟩, ⟨n⟩, ⟨ng⟩ is followed by a plosive or affricate of a different place of articulation, 
the nasal coda may be articulated at the place of articulation for the following consonant instead of the one for its original place of articulation. 
For example, the digraph ⟨mk⟩ can be pronounced as [ŋk] rather than [mk]. For this rule, Palatal consonants are considered a subset of Dental consonants.
* The Stop Coda Rule: If a stop coda ⟨p⟩, ⟨t⟩, ⟨k⟩ is followed by one of the lenis consonant ⟨b⟩, ⟨d⟩, ⟨j⟩, ⟨g⟩,
the coda can be dropped in exchange for pronouncing the following consonant as its fortis counterpart.
* The ⟨ph⟩ Rule: The diagraph ⟨ph⟩ may be pronounced as /f/.
* The ⟨ty/dy⟩ Rule: The digraphs ⟨ty⟩ and ⟨dy⟩ may be pronounced as /tɕ/ and /dʑ/ respectively.
* The ⟨kh⟩ Rule: In the diagraph ⟨kh⟩, the /k/ may be dropped.

In case of any confusion, it is recommended that you clarify your pronunciation to the best of your ability 
by either inserting dummy vowels or simply not utilizing the above diagraph rules in favor of speaking slower.

# 2. Particles

In Manmino, the function of a word as a noun, verb, adjective or adverb is primarily identified through position and particles, 
both pre-positional and post-positional. 
As such, in Manmino, words in isolation are classified not as nouns, verbs, and modifiers,
but as objects and concepts, actions and phenomena, and qualities. 
Their function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb is determined by the particles around them.

## 2.1 Noun Particles

Manmino nouns are marked with the following post-positional particles that determine the function of the noun.

|     Particle    |   Function  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|:---------------:|:-----------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|        na       |    Topic    | Mrks the noun phrase as the topic of the sentence. Similarly to Japanese and Korean, the particle may also be used to also emphasize a noun as the subject.     |
|        ∅        |  Nominative | In Manmino, the subject is unmarked.                                                                                                                           |
|        lu       |  Accusative | Marks the noun as the direct object of the sentence. It is optional when word order is Subject-Object-Verb, but otherwise is required.                          |
|       ji*       |   Genitive  | Marks the noun as the possessor of the next item in the noun phrase.                                                                                            |
|       bat       |   Ablative  | Marks the noun as the origin of the verb. Equivalent to English "from".                                                                                         |
|       bang      |    Lative   | Marks the noun as the destination of the verb. Equivalent to English "to" when used in referencing a location.                                                  |
| ne <sup>1</sup> |    Dative   | Marks the noun as the indirect object of the sentence. Equivalent to "to" in reference to a target of action.                                                   |
| ne <sup>2</sup> |    Agent    | Marks the noun as the agent in a passive voice construction. Equivalent to prepositional ”by”.                                                                  |
|        la       |   Quoting   | Marks a noun or a noun phrase as a quote or a hypothetical.                                                                                                     |


Manmino nouns are notable for not accounting for number or any gender: 
plurality in Manmino can be emphasized with either reduplication of the noun or with the suffix _-tat_. 

## 2.2 Verb Modifiers

Manmino verbs are augmented with optional particles for multiple aspects, conveying information in the following order.

| Passive | Polite | Imperative | Progressive | Completion |    Time   |     Final    |
|:-------:|:------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:----------:|:---------:|:------------:|
|    li   |   si   |      ye     |     jung    |  le / kalu | le / kalu | ya / ka / ne |

* Passive _li_ changes the verb to that the subject is no longer doing the verb, but the verb is being done to them.
* Polite _si_ is one way a Manmino speaker can show reverence to the subject.
* Imperative is how a verb is made into a command.
* Progressive marks a verb is in the middle of being performed at whichever time that is being referred to (assumed present, if otherwise unmarked).
* Completion can be either marked with le (perfect) and kalu (prospective). They normally only function if tense for verb is already marked.
* Time marks when the verb is happening. Le marks past, kalu marks the future, and the present tense is unmarked. 
However, it is acceptable to drop tense marking if apparent.
* Final marks the verb in multiple ways. 
ya marks a sentence as an exclamation, ka marks a sentence as a strong question, and ne marks a sentence as a weak question or a suggestion. 

It is noted here that prior versions of Manmino described time marking preceding completion,
but now has been switched to better reflect the Korean tense-stacking system from which this system has been borrowed from. 

## 2.3 Word Function Modifiers

As stated earlier, in Manmino, base words are classified as Actions and Phenomenon, Objects and Concepts, or Qualities. 
Generally, each correspond to verbs, nouns, and adjectives or adverbs.
However, there are often cases where a word is not used in its most natural method.
In those cases, a word generally must take on a helping verb or a particle to mark so.
The modifers are as such:

|                       | Verb | Noun | Adjective | Adverb |
|:---------------------:|:----:|:----:|:---------:|:------:|
| Actions and Phenomena |  ∅  |  -em  |     ji   |    ∅   |
|  Objects and Concepts | heng |   ∅  |    -dek  |  -yang  |
|        Quality        | cey  |  -em  |     ∅   |    ∅   |

An action or phenomeon being "used as an adverb" is generally expressed more commonly as verb chains,
which can simply be put next to each other without modification. 
It is here noted that previous versions of Manmino had the particle marking an O/C as an adverb as _-syang_, 
but it is now changed to _-yang_ to make pronunciation easier and better reflect Classical Chinese,
which uses the corresponding etymology more frequenty.

Negation is also another type of word function modifier, and quite unique in that it is the only prefixing particle in Manmino.
Manmino negates verbs with a _but-_, and negates adjectives and adverbs with _bi-_. _But-cey_ can be abbreviated to _bey_.

## 2.4 Independant Particles

There are also particles that function independently from words instead being attached to any one phrase. 
These can either function as conjunctions placed between clauses, or be used at the start of the sentence as a function marker for the phrase.

| Conjunction | Description                                                       |
|:-----------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|      i      | Equivalent to and. Sets two clauses as co-ordinate to each other. |
|     hwa     | Equivalent to and. Sets two nouns as part of one noun phrase.     |
|     hok     | Equivalent to or. Sets two clauses as alternative to one another. |
|     pi      | Sets two clauses as objects of comparisons to each other.         |
|     dan     | Equivalent to ᅟbut, however, still, or only. Sets the following clause as a prevaling clause.   |
|   butdan    | Equivalent to not only. Setsthe following clause as a compounding clause.                      |

| Functional | Description                                                                                                                  |
|:----------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    nyak    | Equivalent to if. Marks the following two clauses as a hypothetical clause and a concluding clause.                          |
|     yu     | Equivalent to because. Marks the following two clauses as a causal clause and a final clause.                                |
|     wi     | Equivalent to for. Marks the following two clauses as an objective clause and a instrumental clause.                         |

While the functionals are not conjunctions, in order to emulate conjunctions, the functional particles above can be used in special constructions.
For example, _Nyak_ can be placed after the hypothetical clause 
if it was used as part of the phrase "_la, nyak ko,_" placed in between the two clauses instead of ahead of the two.
Similarly, _yu_ and _wi_ can be placed after their initial clause by being used in phrases "_i, yu ko,_" or "_i, wi ko,_".

# 3. Pronouns

Manmino has a simple system of pronouns. 
In terms of personal pronouns, 
Manmino has the first person pronoun _a_, 
the second person pronoun _ni_, 
and the third person pronoun _ta_.
There are also _kun_, _nyang_, _ini_, 
which are gendered and intimate alternatives to the second or third person pronouns.
Each correspond to male, female, and neuter.

Manmino has a modular system for generating other pronouns. 
Manmino pronouns have the following demonstrative parameters: 
first person proximal _ko_, non-first person proximal _co_, distal _yo_, 
interrogative _ha_, existential _hok_, universal _man_, negative _mu_, and alternative _ta_. 
These can be optionally suffixed to specify the target being demonstrated.
Objects are suffixed with _-ka_, people are suffixed with _-nin_, times are suffixed with _-si_, places are suffixed with _-di_,
causes are suffixed with _-yu_, and method is suffixed with _-'i_.
It is noted that many universal pronouns do not use the standard target specifying suffixes 
due to prevailing pre-existing words in Sinoxenic languages.

|         | 1st Proximal | Non-1st Proximal | Distal | Interrogative | Particular | Universal | Negative | Alternative |
|---------|--------------|------------------|--------|---------------|------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
|         | this         | that             | yon    | Which         | Certain    | All       | None     | Other       |
| General | ko           | co               | yo     | ha            | hok        | man       | mu       | ta          |
